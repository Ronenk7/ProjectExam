## **Full Stack Automation Final Project**
### **_This project demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing._**
***
### _About_
The project demonstrates a smart automation infrastructure. In this project we emphasize the hierarchy order of the project structure.
In this way, the tests can be created with no complications.
**Most important advantage of the infrastructure is the ability to be easily maintained!**
### _Project Overview_
Application types:
* Mobile application
### **_The Infrastructure:_**
* Page Object Design Pattern
* Project Layers(Extensions/Work Flows/Test Cases...)
* Support of Different Clients/Browsers
* Screenshots
* Video Recording
* Failure Mechanism
* Common Functionality
* External Files Support
* Reporting System (including screenshots)
* CI support
***
### _Applications List:_
* ZIM Shipping - Mobile application
### _Tools & Frameworks:_
* TestNG - Testing Framework
* Listeners - interface used to generate logs and customize the TestNG reports
* Jenkins - for tests execution
* Allure Reports - as the main reporting system
### _Known Issues:_
Consequently, that the experitest dependencies can not co-exist with appium dependencies, there are 
some changes that will have to be made in the code.
In essence, when we want to run the desktop app we need to disable the mobile support and vice versa.
